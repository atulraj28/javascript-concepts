    FIRST
script is not needed if used in .js file but it must be conected. To connect use <script src="path"></script>.
if you want to run the script before body then put the script in the head and if later in then put it in the body.

DAY1
if we use external javascript then it is comparatively faster for the web to executite the operationn and it is also 
because javascript is saved in chases to compile it even faster 
"async" is an attribute used in the connection script in the external js it download parralely and exicute it after downlod
it is the same function which is done by default so it is not usually needed
"defer" is another attribute used inthe connnection script which first read the whole html and then download the script 
which is sometimes can give error while compiling.
"document.getElementById("idname").innerHTML="anythig that the user want to say"; this method also can show message of the tag 
which has the idname.
"document.write("aything that you want to writ"); it does not work with defer.
"console.log("anyhting you want to print in the console"); it only write in console.
